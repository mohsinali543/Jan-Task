   <h1> Election of Pakistan </h1>

   Balloting and elections stand at the very core of any demographic system. 
   While Pakistan has a general election scheduled for February, 
   huge questions are already arising – as has been the case in previous polling 
   exercises.

The level playing field demanded by most parties has quite clearly been 
tilted in a specific direction, 
in an attempt to ensure what the outcome of the people’s vote will be. 
People, it seems, do not matter in the success which costs taxpayers
 a huge amount of money and the national exchequer even more.

 <h2> Italian Pizza </h2>
 In 2024, Italy may see a surge in pineapple pizza, 
 thanks to pizzaiolo (pizza maestro) Gino Sorbillo, 
 who has introduced the dreaded "bananas" to his menu on Via dei Tribunali,
  the world capital of pizza.

Pizza with pineapple is anathema to most Italians, 
 and Sorbillo’s new pizza caused an uproar with insults on social media
  and national TV discussions.
